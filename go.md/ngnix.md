If you're using **Nginx** on Windows, here’s how you can get started:

---

### **1. Download Nginx**
1. Go to the official [Nginx download page](https://nginx.org/en/download.html).
2. Download the latest stable version for Windows (e.g., `nginx-x.x.x.zip`).

---

### **2. Install Nginx**
1. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder, such as `C:\nginx`.
2. Open the `nginx` folder. You'll see a structure like this:
   ```
   C:\nginx
   ├── conf
   ├── html
   ├── logs
   └── nginx.exe
   ```

---

### **3. Start Nginx**
1. Open a **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**.
2. Navigate to the Nginx directory:
   ```cmd
   cd C:\nginx
   ```
3. Start Nginx:
   ```cmd
   nginx.exe
   ```

- Nginx should now be running. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost`. You should see the default Nginx welcome page.

---

### **4. Basic Configuration**
The main configuration file is `conf\nginx.conf` in the Nginx directory.

1. Open the configuration file in a text editor:
   ```cmd
   notepad C:\nginx\conf\nginx.conf
   ```
2. Modify it to suit your needs. For example, to set up a basic website:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name localhost;

       root C:/nginx/html;
       index index.html;

       location / {
           try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
       }
   }
   ```

3. Save the file and reload Nginx:
   ```cmd
   nginx.exe -s reload
   ```

---

### **5. Create Your Website**
1. Place your HTML files in the `html` folder:
   - For example: `C:\nginx\html\index.html`.
2. Access your site at `http://localhost`.

---

### **6. Stop Nginx**
To stop Nginx:
```cmd
nginx.exe -s stop
```

---

### **7. Run Nginx as a Windows Service (Optional)**
Running Nginx as a service ensures it starts automatically with Windows.

1. Use a tool like **NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager)** to register Nginx as a service. Download NSSM from [https://nssm.cc/](https://nssm.cc/).
2. Install the service:
   ```cmd
   nssm install nginx
   ```
3. Configure the application path to `C:\nginx\nginx.exe`.
