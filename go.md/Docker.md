# Docker Beginner's Tutorial

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. Containers can run on any system that supports Docker, ensuring consistency across different environments.

### Key Features of Docker
- **Portability:** Write once, run anywhere.
- **Isolation:** Separate containers for different applications.
- **Efficiency:** Containers use fewer resources than virtual machines.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale applications by running multiple containers.

### Why Do We Need Docker?
1. **Environment Consistency:** Avoid the "it works on my machine" problem.
2. **Faster Development:** Quickly set up environments and test changes.
3. **Simplified Deployment:** Package the application and dependencies together.
4. **Resource Efficiency:** Containers share the host OS, reducing overhead.

## Getting Started with Docker

### Installation
1. Download Docker Desktop from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/).
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
3. Verify installation by running:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

## Creating a Docker Image with a Dockerfile

A **Dockerfile** is a script that contains instructions to build a Docker image.

### Example Dockerfile
Below is a sample Dockerfile for a simple Python application:
```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory's content to the container's /app directory
COPY . /app

# Install application dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 5000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Explanation of Dockerfile Commands
- `FROM`: Specifies the base image (e.g., `python:3.9-slim`).
- `WORKDIR`: Sets the working directory inside the container.
- `COPY`: Copies files from the host to the container.
- `RUN`: Executes commands during the build process (e.g., install dependencies).
- `EXPOSE`: Documents the port the container will use.
- `CMD`: Specifies the command to run when the container starts.

### Build a Docker Image
To build a Docker image from the Dockerfile:
```bash
docker build -t my-python-app .
```
- `-t`: Tags the image with a name (`my-python-app`).
- `.`: Refers to the current directory containing the Dockerfile.

## Security Best Practices for Docker Images

### 1. Use Official Base Images
- Start with minimal and verified base images, such as those from trusted repositories like `python:3.9-slim`.

### 2. Minimize Layers
- Combine related commands into a single `RUN` instruction to reduce the image size.
```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

### 3. Avoid Hardcoding Secrets
- Never store sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys) in the Dockerfile. Use environment variables or secret management tools.

### 4. Use Multi-Stage Builds
- Use a build stage to compile or build your application, and a separate, smaller stage for the final image.
```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.18 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o main .

FROM alpine:latest
COPY --from=builder /app/main .
CMD ["./main"]
```

### 5. Regularly Update Images
- Update base images and dependencies to fix vulnerabilities.

### 6. Scan Images for Vulnerabilities
- Use tools like `docker scan` to identify security issues:
```bash
docker scan my-python-app
```
7. changing the user from root to a non-root user

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
RUN groupadd -r <group-name> && useradd --no-log-init -r -g <group-name> <user-name> 

USER nonroot
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
---

## Using the `.dockerignore` File

The `.dockerignore` file is used to exclude files and directories from being included in the Docker image during the build process. This reduces the image size and improves security.

### Example `.dockerignore` File
```plaintext
# Ignore log files
*.log

# Ignore node_modules directory
node_modules/

# Ignore git files
.git

# Ignore temporary files
*.tmp
```

### Benefits of Using `.dockerignore`
- **Smaller Images:** Exclude unnecessary files, reducing image size.
- **Improved Build Performance:** Avoid copying large files or directories.
- **Enhanced Security:** Prevent sensitive files (e.g., `.env`) from being included.

To use `.dockerignore`, place it in the same directory as your Dockerfile. Docker automatically respects this file during the `docker build` process.

## Running a Docker Container

### Start a Container
Run a container using the built image:
```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name my-container my-python-app
```
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode.
- `-p`: Maps host port 5000 to container port 5000.
- `--name`: Assigns a name to the container (`my-container`).

### View Running Containers
```bash
docker ps
```

### Stop a Container
```bash
docker stop my-container
```

### Remove a Container
```bash
docker rm my-container
```

---

## Managing Docker Images

### Pull an Image
Download an image from Docker Hub:
```bash
docker pull nginx
```

### Push an Image
Push a locally built image to Docker Hub:
```bash
docker push my-username/my-python-app
```

### Remove an Image
Delete a local image:
```bash
docker rmi my-python-app
```

---

## Working with Volumes

Volumes allow you to persist data outside of containers.

### Create and Attach a Volume
```bash
docker volume create my-volume
```
Run a container with a volume:
```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name my-container -v my-volume:/app/data my-python-app
```
- `-v my-volume:/app/data`: Mounts the volume `my-volume` to `/app/data` inside the container.

### List Volumes
```bash
docker volume ls
```

### Remove a Volume
```bash
docker volume rm my-volume
```
