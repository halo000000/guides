Hereâ€™s a list of the **most used protocols**, categorized by their primary functions:

### **1. Networking and Communication Protocols**
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: Used for transferring web pages and data on the internet.
- **HTTPS (HTTP Secure)**: A secure version of HTTP using encryption (SSL/TLS).
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: For transferring files between systems.
- **SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)**: Secure file transfer over SSH.
- **SSH (Secure Shell)**: For secure remote login and command execution.
- **Telnet**: For remote login (less secure, often replaced by SSH).
- **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**: Used for managing and monitoring network devices.
- **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)**: Access and manage emails on a server.
- **POP3 (Post Office Protocol)**: Download emails from a server to a local client.
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: For sending emails.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- **NTP (Network Time Protocol)**: Synchronizes clocks across systems.

### **2. Internet and Web Protocols**
- **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**: Core protocols for reliable data transfer over the internet.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Lightweight protocol for faster, less reliable data transfer (e.g., video streaming).
- **WebSocket**: For full-duplex communication over a single TCP connection, often used in real-time web applications.

---

### **3. File Sharing and Storage Protocols**
- **SMB (Server Message Block)**: Used for sharing files and printers in Windows environments.
- **NFS (Network File System)**: For sharing files across Unix/Linux systems.
- **BitTorrent**: Peer-to-peer file sharing protocol.
- **TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)**: A simpler version of FTP, often used for firmware upgrades.

### **4. Security and Authentication Protocols**
- **SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security)**: For encrypting communication (used in HTTPS, email, etc.).
- **IPSec (Internet Protocol Security)**: Secures IP communication by authenticating and encrypting each packet.
- **Kerberos**: Network authentication protocol.
- **OAuth**: Used for delegated access to resources (e.g., logging into apps with Google or Facebook).
- **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**: For single sign-on (SSO) authentication.

---

### **5. Streaming and Multimedia Protocols**
- **RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol)**: Used for delivering audio and video over IP networks.
- **RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol)**: For controlling streaming media servers.
- **HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)**: Apple's protocol for streaming video.

---

### **6. Device and IoT Protocols**
- **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)**: Lightweight protocol for IoT communication.
- **CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol)**: Used in IoT devices for lightweight communication.
- **Zigbee/Z-Wave**: For smart home device communication.

---

### **7. Database and Directory Protocols**
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**: Used for querying databases.
- **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**: Used for directory services (e.g., Active Directory).
- **ODBC/JDBC**: For database connectivity.

---

### **8. Virtual Private Network (VPN) Protocols**
- **OpenVPN**: Open-source VPN protocol.
- **PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol)**: Basic VPN protocol, now considered outdated.
- **L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)**: Often used with IPSec for VPNs.
- **IKEv2 (Internet Key Exchange v2)**: A VPN protocol providing speed and stability.

---

### **Most Popular Protocols in Daily Use**
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Browsing the web.
- **DNS**: Translating domain names.
- **SMTP/IMAP/POP3**: Email services.
- **SSH**: Remote administration.
- **FTP/SFTP**: File transfers.
- **SNMP**: Network monitoring.
- **NTP**: Clock synchronization.
